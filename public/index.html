        High Performance Computing
        High Performance Computing (HPC) plays an important role
        in both scientific advancement and economic competitiveness 
        of a nation - making production of scientific and industrial
        solutions faster, less expensive, and of higher quality. 
        HPC is a key component in many applications: designing 
        vehicles and airplanes; designing high-rise buildings and 
        bridges; discovery of drugs; discovery and extraction of 
        new energy sources like oil and natural gas; weather 
        forecasting; and many more.
